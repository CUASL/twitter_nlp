# twythonx

Twythonx is a library that can search tweet and post tweet. Moreover, Twythonx includes inter-process communication library which is called IPCx.  
You can search tweet and select parameter to search. For more information about search parameter of twitter [here](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/search/api-reference/get-search-tweets).

IPCx stands for Inter-process communication x.
Our IPC type is publish–subscribe pattern. Now we are developing it with **matlab** and **python3** which are based on **ROS** .
The IPCx runs python3 on WSL but runs matlab on Windows 10. 

## Version of Software
We developed on
software|version
----------- | -------------
WSL |Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
Python | Python 3.8.2 64 bit
Matlab| 2020a
ROS | ROS Noetic Ninjemys (ROS 1)

Moreover, IPCx require **ROS Toolbox** on Matlab.
* For more information about ROS Toolbox: [https://www.mathworks.com/products/ros.html](https://www.mathworks.com/products/ros.html)

* For installation of ROS Toolbox: [https://www.mathworks.com/help/ros/ug/install-robotics-system-toolbox-support-packages.html](https://www.mathworks.com/help/ros/ug/install-robotics-system-toolbox-support-packages.html)

## Installation
1.Install WSL, Python3, Matlab 

2.Install required python library : 
* twython
* pandas

please run this following command on WSL
```bash
pip3 install pandas
pip3 install twython
```


3.Install [ROS](http://wiki.ros.org/noetic/Installation/Ubuntu)
> you can see our ROS installation tutorial at [https://github.com/CUASL/ipcx/wiki/Installation](https://github.com/CUASL/ipcx/wiki/Installation)

4.Copy our library folder [ipcx](https://github.com/CUASL/ipcx/tree/master/ipcx) on our github
to your project directory so that you can use our library.

5.import our library in your code
    
python
```python
import twythonx
```
matlab
```matlab
addpath('twythonx')
```

## Usage
You can get start and see more tutorial [wiki](https://github.com/CUASL/ipcx/wiki)

### How to run(For twitter API only)
If you want to use only twitter API, you can install only twitter API(twythonxx) and for more information at  [here](https://github.com/CUASL/twitterAPI)

*Note* For twythonx you must run python3 on WSL only, but in twythonxx can run on Windows, Mac, Ubuntu, WSL, etc.
This example will show how to run on WSL.

*   **step 1** open WSL
*   **step 2**  run following command (replace your file Name)
```bash
python3 yourFileName.py
```


### How to run(For using IPCx and using twitterAPI+IPCx)
This example will show case server: python and client: matlab

*    **step 1** open WSL
```bash
roscore
```

*   **step 2** open another WSL and run your serverfile  (replace your file Name)
```bash
python3 yourServerFileName.py
```

*For Example in example directory*
```bash
python3 ex_publisher.py
```

*   **step 3** open matlab and run your client file (replace your file Name)

*for example(run in matlab bash or you can click run at matlab UI)*
```matlab
ex_subscriber
```
